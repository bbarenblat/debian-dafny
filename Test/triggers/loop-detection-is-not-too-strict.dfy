// subexpression to match a trigger without reporting a loop and without being
// equal to that trigger, as long as the only differences are variable

  // only differ by their variables, though, they won't raise flags.

  // This works independent of extra parentheses:
  assume forall x: int, y: int :: P(x, y) == (P(y, x));

  // Contrast with the following:
  assume forall x: int, y: int :: P(x, y) == P(x, y+1);
